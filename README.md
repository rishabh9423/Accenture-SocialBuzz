# SocialBuzz Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project is a data analysis task for a hypothetical client, SocialBuzz—a social media platform. The objective of this project is to clean the provided data and calculate a score for each post based on the reactions it received. The score is calculated by assigning different weights to various reaction types. The findings and outcomes of this analysis are presented in a PowerPoint (PPT) slide deck, summarizing insights into SocialBuzz’s content engagement.

Dataset
SocialBuzz provided three raw data files:

Content.csv: Contains information on each post, such as post ID, content type, and timestamps.
Reaction.csv: Holds data on reactions to posts, including the post ID and the reaction type.
ReactionTypes.csv: Lists each unique reaction type with assigned weights for scoring purposes.
Objectives
Data Cleaning: Clean the provided datasets to ensure consistency and remove any inaccuracies.
Data Transformation: Merge the datasets into a unified format for analysis.
Scoring Calculation: Calculate a score for each post by assigning weights based on reaction types.
Insights and Reporting: Present the findings in a PPT, including key insights on engagement patterns.
Analysis Process
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats across datasets.
Data Merging: Integrated data from Content, Reaction, and ReactionTypes files to create a comprehensive dataset.
Score Calculation: Calculated scores by applying weights to each reaction type.
Visualization and Insights: Created visualizations and analysis summaries in a PowerPoint presentation.
Results
The findings of this analysis, along with visualizations, are summarized in the Presentation.pptx file. Key insights include:

Identification of top-performing post types.
Engagement levels across various reaction types.
Recommendations for content strategies based on engagement metrics.
